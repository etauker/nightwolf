# Nightwolf Client

A configurable REST API client.

The client will come in three parts:
- **nightwolf-core**: a javascript library that can be embedded into other projects (WIP)
- **nightwolf-cli**: a planned implementation that extends the core library with a CLI interface
- **nightwolf-rest**: a planned implementation that can be hosted locally as a proxy backend for use with your own frontend implementation
